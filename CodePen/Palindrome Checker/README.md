## Project Description
This is a simple web application that checks if a given word or sentence is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward when you ignore punctuation, spaces, and case differences.

## Features
- Allows users to input a string and check if it's a palindrome.
- Ignores punctuation, spaces, and case to ensure accurate results.
- Provides feedback to the user with a message indicating whether the input is a palindrome.
- Responsive and interactive design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the palindrome logic and user interactions.

## How to Use
1. Enter a word or phrase into the input field.
2. Click the **Check** button or press **Enter** to check if the input is a palindrome.
3. The result will appear below the input field, showing whether the input is a palindrome or not.
